# Rail-Track-Curve-Angle-Calculator
Deprecated project.

Made this to satisfy my curiosity. This simple program calculates, takes a few parameters such as the speed of the train, radius of the curve, and angle of the track relative to the ground. Choose which parameters to insert and it will calculate the others.

You can also insert all of the parameters at once and it will tell you if the curve you inserted is fine or not.

I am planning to use this in a bigger project in the future.
